# Setup: RStudio Shortcuts

*Purpose*: Your ability to get stuff done is highly dependent on your fluency
with your tools. One aspect of fluency is knowing and *using* keyboard
shortcuts. In this exercise, we'll go over some of the most important ones.

*Reading*: [Keyboard shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts); [Code Chunk Options](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)

*Note*: Use this reading to look up answers to the questions below. Rather than *memorizing* this information, I recommend you download a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/rstudio-ide.pdf), and either print it out or save it in a convenient place on your computer. Get used to referencing your cheatsheets while doing data science---practice makes perfect!
- If this link is broken, try searching "Rstudio IDE cheatsheet" on the web.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### __q1__ What do the following keyboard shortcuts do?

* Within the script editor or a chunk

    * `Alt` + `-` writes =


    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `M` writes the pipe symbol, %>% 


    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter` runs the line of code


    * `F1` (Note: on a Mac you need to press `fn` + `F1`) opens a help window?


	* `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C` comments out code



* Within R Markdown

    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I` creates a chunk of code


* Within a chunk

    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`runs the entire chunk


    * `Ctrl` + `I` (`Cmd` + `I`) goes to the next line


Try this below!

```{r}
## Re-indent these lines
c(
  "foo",
  "bar",
  "goo",
  "gah"
)
```


### __q2__ For a chunk, what header option do you use to

* Run the code, don't display it, but show its results?
echo=FALSE

* Run the code, but don't display it or its results?
include=FALSE

### __q3__ How do stop the code in a chunk from running once it has started?
Click the red square

### __q4__ How do you show the "Document Outline" in RStudio?

*Hint*: Try googling "rstudio document outline"

Outline button in the top right corner of file editor.
